# JavaScript-Tea-Recipe

This project demonstrates how to create a fully functional tea recipe webpage using only JavaScript, without relying on external or inline CSS for styling. All the layout, styling, and interactivity are handled using JavaScript and the DOM.

**Project Overview**

This project creates a webpage that provides instructions on how to make tea. The entire webpage structure, styling, and interactive features are generated using JavaScript. It demonstrates how JavaScript can replace HTML and CSS by directly manipulating the DOM to generate the webpage dynamically.

**Features**

Dynamic Layout: The page layout is generated using JavaScript, including header, content, and footer.
Icon Hover Effects: The ingredients and preparation sections include interactive hover effects on Font Awesome icons.
Responsive Design: JavaScript is used to handle responsiveness, adjusting the page layout based on the screen width.
Step-by-Step Preparation: The recipe includes a step-by-step guide with hover interactions

**Technologies Used**

HTML: Minimal use to link the JavaScript file and Font Awesome icons.
JavaScript: Handles the entire structure, styling, and interactivity of the webpage.
Font Awesome: External library for adding icons.
Responsive Design
The project uses JavaScript to handle responsiveness. When the screen width goes below 768px, the layout adjusts to be mobile-friendly, and the font sizes scale appropriately.

**Acknowledgments**

This project was inspired by a challenge to build a recipe page entirely using JavaScript from Code Institute. The concept explores the possibilities of using JavaScript for both functionality and styling, replacing traditional HTML and CSS usage.
